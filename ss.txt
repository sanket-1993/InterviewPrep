Development is in Agile =>
Custoer support is in Kanban => 2 members from team

Injetion of data => window based service , injected files or metadata


Audit flow =>either third party or an auditor. auditor of application.

Appeal flow => between appeal judge and agent ref. If the agent is diagree with evaluation he can appeal . Agent will go to agent representative (Agent rep).
 Agent ref will appeal on behalf of agent for rescore. judge will republish the evaluation. Agent will always acknowledge re published evaluation.
 for every question he can appeal twice. but what if he still not satisfied with his current evaluation? original evaluator will republish evaluation

Evaluation flow => Evaluator of application.Analytics engine will identify the call . it also search phrases
Calibration flow => Supervising of Evaluations perfomed by evaluator.

Self evaluation => while publishing agent also receives self evaluation
2 parts => Evaluator will allow agent to self evaluation
part 2 => Agent can self evaluate himself(senior angents)

2 web portal=>
main portal -> other users can login to both portals 
evaluations portal -> Agents only allowed -> self evalutaion or assigned self evalutions-> they can only see there published evaluations.

There is also coaching activity . only while doing evaluation not seperate functionality

We are providing the generic fix which will work irrespective of any metadata field is disabled. All agents will be able to access the evaluation page.
Now to find the impacted agents from the system, we are going to prepare a query which will fetch the impacted agents due to such disabled metadata fields.
