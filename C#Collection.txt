Difference between abstraction and encapsulation.

  - Abstraction solves problem at design level while Encapsulation solves problem at implementation level.
  - Abstraction hides complexity by giving you a more abstract picture of the system while Encapsulation hides internal working so that 
	you can change it later.
  - Abstraction hides the irrelevant details found in the code whereas Encapsulation helps developers to organize the entire code easily.

WHAT IS ASTRACT CLASS AND INTERFACE
An interface can be used to define a contract behavior and it can also act as a contract between two systems to interact 
while an abstract class is mainly used to define default behavior for subclasses, 
it means that all child classes should have performed the same functionality.
------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
WHEN TO USE ABSTRACT CLASS?

When to use an abstract class
-An abstract class is a good choice if we are using the inheritance concept since it provides a common base class implementation to 
	derived classes.
-An abstract class is also good if we want to declare non-public members. In an interface, all methods must be public.
-If we want to add new methods in the future, then an abstract class is a better choice. 
	Because if we add new methods to an interface, then all of the classes that already implemented that interface will have 
	to be changed to implement the new methods.
-If we want to create multiple versions of our component, create an abstract class. 
	Abstract classes provide a simple and easy way to version our components. By updating the base class, 
	all inheriting classes are automatically updated with the change. 
	Interfaces, on the other hand, cannot be changed once created. 
	If a new version of an interface is required, we must create a whole new interface.
-Abstract classes have the advantage of allowing better forward compatibility. 
	Once clients use an interface, we cannot change it; if they use an abstract class, 
		we can still add behavior without breaking the existing code.
	If we want to provide common, implemented functionality among all implementations of our component, use an abstract class.
-Abstract classes allow us to partially implement our class, whereas interfaces contain no implementation for any members.
 
------------------------------------------------ 
------------------------------------------------

WHEN TO USE AN INTERFACE -
-If the functionality we are creating will be useful across a wide range of disparate objects, use an interface.
	Abstract classes should be used primarily for objects that are closely related, 
	whereas interfaces are best suited for providing a common functionality to unrelated classes.
-Interfaces are a good choice when we think that the API will not change for a while.
-Interfaces are also good when we want to have something similar to multiple inheritances since we can implement multiple interfaces.
-If we are designing small, concise bits of functionality, use interfaces. 
  If we are designing large functional units, use an abstract class.
-------------------------------------------------

WHY ABSTRACT CLASS FOR COMMON FUNCTIONALITY OTHER THAN CLASS?
MEMORY MANAGEMENT WITH ABSTRACT CLASS?

"When the base class is a normal class ( i.e. not an abstract class), 
then wouldn't the base class be automatically instantiated ..."

When a derived class is instantiated a single memory allocation is made. 
That allocation is used to store all the fields of the derived class and all other classes in its inheritance chain, 
there is no distinct memory allocation made for any base class.

--------------------------------------------------
abstract class can implement interface-->yes

-----------------------------
Can abstract class have constructor?
- An abstract class can have a constructor BUT you can not create an object of abstract class so how do you use that constructor?
- Thing is when you inherit that abstract class in your subclass you can pass values to its(abstract's) constructor through 
	super(value) method in your subclass and no you don't inherit a constructor.
- so using super you can pass values in a constructor of the abstract class and as far as I remember it has to be the first statement 
	in your method or constructor.

    public class Maruti: Car
    {
        public Maruti(int wheels): base(wheels)
        {

        }
    }
	
-----------------------------
- Abstract type can not be sealed and static	**********
-----------------------------
WHAT IS DIFF BETWEEN IQUERYABLE AND IENUMERABLE.

 -IEnumerable exists in System.Collections Namespace. -IQueryable exists in System. Linq Namespace.
 -IEnumerable doesn’t support lazy loading.           -IQueryable support lazy loading
 -Querying data from a database, IEnumerable execute a select query on the server side, load data in-memory on a client-side and then 
	filter data so it does more work and it is slow.
 -Querying data from a database, IQueryable execute the select query on the server side with all filters so it is fast.
 -When querying data from in-memory collections like List, Array etc you should use IEnumerable. 
 -When querying data from out-memory (like remote database, service) collections you should use IQueryable
 
dbContext dc = new dbContext ();
IEnumerable<SocialMedia> list = dc.SocialMedias.Where(p => p.Name.StartsWith("T"));
list = list.Take<SocialMedia>(1);

internally converted to SELECT [t0].[ID], [t0].[Name] FROM [SocialMedia] AS [t0] WHERE [t0].[Name] LIKE @p0

dbContext dc = new dbContext ();
IQueryable<SocialMedia> list = dc.SocialMedias.Where(p => p.Name.StartsWith("T"));
list = list.Take<SocialMedia>(1);

 internally converted to SELECT TOP 1 [t0].[ID], [t0].[Name] FROM [SocialMedia] AS [t0] WHERE [t0].[Name] LIKE @p0
-----------------------------
static constructor VS normal constructor
->static constructor gets called only once
 - Static constructors cannot be inherited or overloaded.
 - A static constructor cannot be called directly and is only meant to be called by the common language runtime (CLR). 
	It is invoked automatically.
 - Access modifiers are not allowed on static constructor	
-----------------------------
-----------------------------
Can static constructor be overloaded
No. parameterized static constructor is not possible.
-----------------------------
-----------------------------
Why constructor is private?
 To prevent class instantiation outside scope of class. -> Used in singleton design pattern

-----------------------------
CLEAN UP UNMANAGED RESOURCES
	- Although the .NET framework frees managed memory and resources transparently, it's not as adept at freeing unmanaged resources; 
	you have to help it out by implementing the Dispose and Finalize patterns in your code. 
	- When the .NET framework instantiates an object, it allocates memory for that object on the managed heap. 
	- The object remains on the heap until it's no longer referenced by any active code, 
	 at which point the memory it's using is "garbage," ready for memory deallocation by the .NET Garbage Collector (GC). 
	- Before the GC deallocates the memory, the framework calls the object's  Finalize()  method, 
	  but developers are responsible for calling the  Dispose()  method.

	- The two methods are not equivalent. Even though both methods perform object clean-up, there are distinct differences between them. 
	- To design efficient .NET applications, it's essential that you have a proper understanding of both how the .NET framework 
	cleans up objects and when and how to use the Finalize and Dispose methods. 

	- When we create unmanaged objects, GC is unable to clear them and we need to release such objects explicitly when we finished 
		using them. 
	- Mostly unmanaged objects are wrapped/hide around operating system resources like file streams, database connections, 
		network related instances, handles to different classes, registries, pointers etc. 
	- GC is responsible to track the life time of all managed and unmanaged objects but still GC is not aware of releasing 
		unmanaged resources.

 An Insight Into the Dispose and Finalize Methods

	- The .NET garbage collector manages the memory of managed objects (native .NET objects) 
		but it does not manage, nor is it directly able to clean up unmanaged resources. 
	- Managed resources are those that are cleaned up implicitly by the garbage collector. 
	 You do not have to write code to release such resources explicitly. 
	- In contrast, you must clean up unmanaged resources (file handlers, database collections, etc.) explicitly in your code.

	- There are situations when you might need to allocate memory for unmanaged resources from managed code. 
	  As an example, suppose you have to open a database connection from within a class. 
	- The database connection instance is an unmanaged resource encapsulated within this class and should be released as soon as 
		you are done with it. 
	- In such cases, you'll need to free the memory occupied by the unmanaged resources explicitly, 
		because the GC doesn't free them implicitly.

Briefly, the GC works as shown below:

	- It searches for managed objects that are referenced in managed code.
	- It then attempts to finalize those objects that are not referenced in the code.
	- Lastly, it frees the unreferenced objects and reclaims the memory occupied by them.

	- The GC maintains lists of managed objects arranged in "generations." A generation is a measure of the relative lifetime 
	  of the objects in memory. 
	- The generation number indicates to which generation an object belongs. 
	- Recently created objects are stored in lower generations compared to those created earlier in the application's life cycle. 
	  Longer-lived objects get promoted to higher generations. 
	- Because applications tend to create many short-lived objects compared to relatively few long-lived objects, 
	  the GC runs much more frequently to clean up objects in the lower generations than in the higher ones.
	  
It is used to free unmanaged resources like files, database connections etc. at any time.	|| It can be used to free unmanaged resources (when you implement it) like files, database connections etc. held by an object before that object is destroyed.
Explicitly, it is called by user code and the class which is implementing dispose method,   || 
must has to implement IDisposable interface.	                                            || Internally, it is called by Garbage Collector and cannot be called by user code.
It belongs to IDisposable interface.	      												|| It belongs to Object class.
It's implemented by implementing IDisposable interface Dispose() method.					|| It's implemented with the help of destructor in C++ & C#.
There is no performance costs associated with Dispose method.								|| There is performance costs associated with Finalize method since it doesn't clean the memory immediately and called by GC automatically.

public class MyClass : IDisposable
{
 private bool disposed = false;
 
 //Implement IDisposable.
 public void Dispose()
 {
	Dispose(true);
	GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
 }

 protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
 {
	if (!disposed)
	{
	if (disposing)
	{
		// TO DO: clean up managed objects
	}
	
		// TO DO: clean up unmanaged objects
	
	disposed = true;
 }
 }
}

\\\If you want to implement Finalize method, it is recommended to use Finalize and Dispose method together as shown below:

// Using Dispose and Finalize method together
public class MyClass : IDisposable
{
 private bool disposed = false;
 
 //Implement IDisposable.
 public void Dispose()
 {
	Dispose(true);
	GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
 }

 protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
 {
	if (!disposed)
	{
		if (disposing)
		{
		// TO DO: clean up managed objects
		}
		
		// TO DO: clean up unmanaged objects
		
		disposed = true;
	}
 }
 
 //At runtime C# destructor is automatically Converted to Finalize method
 ~MyClass()
 {
 Dispose(false);
 }
} 

** A Dispose method should call the GC.SuppressFinalize() method for the object of a class which has destructor 
	because it has already done the work to clean up the object, then it is not necessary for the garbage collector 
	to call the object's Finalize method.

-----------------------------
WHAT IS MANAGED AND UNMANAGED OBJECTS/RESOURCES?

MANAGED OBJECTS are created, managed and under scope of CLR, pure .NET code managed by runtime, Anything that lies within 
.NET scope and under .NET framework classes such as string, int, bool variables are referred to as managed code.

UNMANAGED OBJECTS are created outside the control of .NET libraries and are not managed by CLR, 
example of such unmanaged code is COM objects, file streams, connection objects, Interop objects. 
(Basically, third party libraries that are referred in .NET code.)
-----------------------------
GARBEG COLLECTION GENERATION STEPS LEVEL??

0 Generation (Zero):This generation holds short-lived objects, e.g., Temporary objects. 
					GC initiates garbage collection process MORE FREQUENTLY in this generation.
					When you instantiate a new object, it goes in this generation by default. 
					The exceptions are objects whose sizes are equal to or greater than 85,000 bytes. 
					Those objects are large, so they go straight into generation 2.
1 Generation (One): This generation is the buffer between short-lived and long-lived objects.
2 Generation (Two): This generation holds long-lived objects like a static and global variable, that needs to be persisted for 
					a certain amount of time. 
					Objects which are not collected in generation Zero, are then moved to generation 1, 
					such objects are known as survivors, similarly objects which are not collected in generation One, 
					are then moved to generation 2 and from there onwards objects remain in the same generation.
					GC takes place here LESS FREQUENTLY.

HOW GC DECIDES IF OBJECTS ARE LIVE?
GC checks the below information to check if the object is live:

 1 - It collects all handles of an object that are allocated by user code or by CLR
 2 - Keeps track of static objects, as they are referenced to some other objects
 3 - Use stack provided by stack walker and JIT
 
WHEN GC GETS TRIGGERED?
There are no specific timings for GC to get triggered, GC automatically starts operation on the following conditions:

 1 - When virtual memory is running out of space.
 2 - When allocated memory is suppressed acceptable threshold (when GC found if the survival rate (living objects) is high, 
		then it increases the threshold allocation).
 3 - When we call GC.Collect() method explicitly, as GC runs continuously, we actually do not need to call this method.

FUNCTION OVERLOADING/OVERRIDING/METHOD HIDING(METHOD SHADOWING)
	- Method hiding is also called shadowing in C#. 
	- We are hiding method of base class in derived class.
	- The method of the parent class is available to the child class without using the override keyword in shadowing. 
	- The child class has its own version of the same function.

Define a behavior that is specific to the subclass type in overriding, you, which means a subclass can implement 
	a parent class method based on its requirement.
Hiding REDEFINES THE COMPLETE METHOD, whereas overriding REDEFINES ONLY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE METHOD.
In Overriding, you can access the base class using the child class’ object overridden method.
Shadowing has cannot access the child class methods from base class object.

Event and DELEGATES

What is a Delegate?
	- Delegate is similar to a function pointer in C & C++ but the delegates are user defined types in C#. 
	- It is a reference type variable that can hold a reference to the methods
	- Make a note that delegates are not a member of class, but similar to a class. These are the backbone for events.

When to use delegates?

	- These are used to represent or refer to one or more functions.
	- These can only be used to define call-back methods.
	- In order to consume a delegate, we need to create an object to delegate.
2 types of delegates->

single cast and multicast
class Program
    {
        public delegate int Delegate(int a);
        public static void Main()
        {
            Test t = new Test();
            Delegate objD = new Delegate(t.Dist);
            Console.WriteLine("O/p from delegate: "+objD(100));
            Console.Read();
        }
        
    }

    class Test
    {
        public int Dist(int a)

Try Catch finally finalize 

Finally
The finally block is used to execute a given set of statements, whether an exception is thrown or not thrown. 
For example, if you open a file, it must be closed whether an exception is raised or not.

******************
Finalize
The Finalize in C# is used to free unmanaged resources like database connections etc. 
The method finalize() is for unmanaged resources.
Finalize() is called by the Garbage Collector before an object that is eligible for collection is reclaimed. 
Garbage collector will take the responsibility to deallocate the memory for the unreferenced object. 
The Garbage Collector calls this method at some point after there are no longer valid references to that object in memory.

The framework does not guarantee that when this will happen, we can force for Garbage Collection but it will hurt performance 
of a program. 
Finalize() belongs to the Object class and it will be called by the runtime.

using System;
namespace DemoApplication{
   public class Demo{
      ~Demo(){
         Console.WriteLine("Finalize called");
      }
   }
}
*****************************
Dispose
There are some resources like windows handles, database connections, network connections, files, etc. 
which cannot be collected by the Garbage Collector. 
If we want to explicitly release some specific objects then this is the best to implement IDisposable and override the Dispose() method of IDisposable interface.

The Dispose() method is not called automatically and we must explicitly call it from a client application when an object is no longer needed. 
Dispose() can be called even if other references to the object are alive.

Microsoft recommends that we implement both Dispose and Finalize when working with unmanaged resources. 
The Finalize implementation would run and the resources would still be released 
when the object is garbage collected even if a developer neglected to call the Dispose method explicitly.

        } while (item != null);
    }
    FINALLY
    {
        reader?.Dispose();
    }

-----------------------------
-----------------------------
WHAT ARE EXTENSION METHODS

Extension methods allow you to inject additional methods without modifying, deriving or recompiling the original class, 
	struct or interface. 
Extension methods can be added to your own custom class, .NET framework classes, or third party classes or interfaces.

		public static class IntExtensions
			 {
				public static bool IsGreaterThan(this int i, int value)
				{
					return i > value;
				}
			}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        int i = 10;

        bool result = i.IsGreaterThan(100); 

        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}

The only difference between a regular static method and an extension method is that the first parameter of the extension method 
	specifies the type that it is going to operator on, preceded by the this keyword.

What is tuple 

The Tuple<T> class was introduced in .NET Framework 4.0. 
A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types. 
It can be used where you want to have a data structure to hold an object with properties, 
	BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO CREATE A SEPARATE TYPE FOR IT.
	
Tuple<int, string, string> person = new Tuple<int, string, string>(1, "Steve", "Jobs");	
var person = Tuple.Create(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
person.Item1; // returns 1
person.Item2; // returns "Steve"
person.Item3; // returns "Jobs"

Tuples can be used in the following scenarios:

When you want to return multiple values from a method without using ref or out parameters.
When you want to pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter.
When you want to hold a database record or some values temporarily without creating a separate class.
