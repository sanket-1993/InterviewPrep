gc.collect?

Forces an immediate garbage collection of all generations.
Use this method to try to reclaim all memory that is inaccessible. It performs a blocking garbage collection of all generations.

All objects, regardless of how long they have been in memory, are considered for collection; however, objects that are referenced in 
managed code are not collected. Use this method to force the system to try to reclaim the maximum amount of available memory.
