Given an array of n elements, the task is to find the greatest number such that it is product of two elements of given array.
​[2:50 PM] Vivek Kumar (Guest)
    
Input : arr[] = {​​​​​10, 3, 5, 30, 35}​​​​​
Output: 30
Explanation: 30 is the product of 10 and 3.

Input : arr[] = {​​​​​2, 5, 7, 8}​​​​​
Output: -1
Explanation: Since, no such element exists.
Input : arr[] = {​​​​​10, 2, 4, 30, 35}​​​​​
Output: -1
Input : arr[] = {​​​​​10, 2, 2, 4, 30, 35}​​​​​
Output: 4
Input : arr[] = {​​​​​17, 2, 1, 35, 30}​​​​​
Output : 35


select * from(
select ename, sal, dense_rank() 
over(order by sal desc)r from Employee) 
where r=&n;

To find to the 2nd highest sal set n = 2
To find 3rd highest sal set n = 3 and so on.
