How do you reflect column change in entity framework?

The "Update Model from Database" is hard/slow to use and is prone to errors. It generates other stuff that you probably don't want/need. 
So manually adding the column that you need will work better. I suggest you do it outside the VS editor since depending on 
how many models/tables, it can be very slow opening the file in VS.

So in Windows Exlorer, right-click on the *.edmx file and open with Notepad (or Notepad++/Textpad).

Search for the text <EntityType Name="YourTableNameToAddColumn">.

Add the property <Property Name="YourNewColumnName" Type="varchar" MaxLength="64" />

Search for the text <MappingFragment StoreEntitySet="YourTableNameToAddColumn">

Add mapping to the new column <ScalarProperty Name="YourNewColumnName" ColumnName="YourNewColumnName"/>

Save the *.edmx file
